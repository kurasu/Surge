## 3rd Party Frameworks

### JUCE

JUCE makes adapting to different audio APIs easy, which we don't need because we
have our own code for that. It is plug-in framework that makes many things easy
at the price of flexibility.

### Qt

Qt might be in a distant future an option worth of considering because we would
get rid alot of Cocoa and Windows specific code. In addition the flexibility
how things can be done would be compared to VSTGUI from a different dimension.
